My [ErgoDox](https://www.ergodox.io/) split keyboard layout

![ergodox-layout.png](./keyboard-layout-editor/ergodox-layout.png)

## Goals

- Stay as close to standard keyboards as possible so moving to other computers is not a challege
- When there is not a 1:1 match in keys try to at least use the same fingers
